# Capsule Networks for Text Classification

A Tensorflow/Keras implementation of Capsule Networks in the paper:

[Kim, J., Jang, S., Park, E., and Choi, S. (2020). Text classification using capsules. Neurocomputing, 376, 214-221.](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0925231219314092)

  - In order to accurately understand and confirm the structure proposed in this paper, I confirmed and supplemented it through the [author's GitHub](https://github.com/TeamLab/text-capsule-network).
- In Testing
  - I tested this model with the IMDB (Acc: 75.67%, Epoch: 5).
- Version
  - Tensorflow == 2.4.1

- How to use this code?
  - After downloading the entire code, just run "run.py".
