# Capsule Networks for Text Classification

A Keras implementation of Capsule Networks in the paper:

[Kim, J., Jang, S., Park, E., & Choi, S. (2020). Text classification using capsules. Neurocomputing, 376, 214-221.](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0925231219314092)

- The layer of the Capsule Networks was implemented by reading the paper.

- In order to understand and confirm the structure of the paper accurately, I verified and implemented it through the [author's GitHub](https://github.com/TeamLab/text-capsule-network).
